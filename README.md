# Project-1.2
Files I use atm:
Testing.java
ColorArray.java
Vertex.java
VertexArray.java
RandomNodes.java
MenuItemArray.java

To do list (Not in any particular order):
1. Update the randomNum() method in RandomNodes.java. It should not double check stuff, it makes the code
really slow for a lot of edges relative to vertice count
2. Rearrange the colorArray in ColorArray.java so the order of colors makes more sense (Make first black like base color)
2b. Labelling every color in MenuItemArray.java (This will suck)
    Try to use the Find&Replace option in your IDE
3. Try to avoid vertices clipping in each other/sides (Vertex.java)
4. Adding connection between Lena's code and Elliot's
   Aka Opening the Testing screen when menu option is chosen and linking inputs from Lena to perameters and
   variables to the RandomNodes class
4b. Adding functionality to the RandomNodes class with "preset" AdjMatrices (Complete/biparted/etc.)
5. Figuring out if there's a way to stretch coordinates to fit any screen (Needs to be applied to basically every class
6. Functionality of not being allowed to choose a color of a connected Vertex
7. Hint Functionality
8. Figuring out and implementing gamemode differences (Maybe with boolean parameters that turn functions on or off)
9. Presentation
10. Feeding AdjMatrix from RandomNodes.java to our Chromatic number code to find and remember Chromatic number
    We also need the starting points etc. from our old code for the hints (I think)

## Meeting 1: 05/10 13:15- 14:45 Attendees: everyone
### Goals by next meeting
- read more literature about the subjects at hand-graph colouring, chromatic numbers, depth/breadth search algorithms 
- create pseudo-code sketches of any idea you have, normal code also works. no need to do extensive debugging just so we understand the concept and logic behind it.

## Meeting 2: 07/10 16:30-20:30 A0.736 Universiteitssingel 40 Attendees: Mihai,Lina,Iga,Roy
### Meeting goals :
- Assign all positions formally(think of which one would you want and are a good fit).

- Decide which path we take and start working on a unified model.

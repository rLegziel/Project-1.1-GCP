so this is the abstract implementation of the coloring method, it will take the following @params
int[] colors = an array of colors that are represented by numbers, the length of this array will be determined by
the vertex with the most edges.

int[][] matrix = the adjacency matrix that was created from the graph. 

int[] done = an array that stores a list of all colors by order with the node used.

int index = the index of the graph you want to check

we want to make sure that we always backtrack and make sure we check everything before it so we know how we can color the current node.


TODO:
1)fix it so if the vertices dont start at 1 but in a different number, and make sure that all graphs are sorted in an ascending order
2)implement the deletion from the colors array correctly.

private int coloring(int[] colors,int[][] matrix,int[] done,int index){
           for (j = index-1;j>0;j--){
           if( matrix[index][j] == 1){
           colors - done[j];
           }
           }
           return colors[0];
           }
